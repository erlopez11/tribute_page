                <h3>July 28, 1866 - December 22, 1943</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">Beatrix Potter was a writer, illustrator, natural scientist, and conservationist best known for her children's books featuring animals, which have sold more than 250 million copies. Potter was born on July 28, 1866 at 2 Bolton Gardens, West Brompton, London into an upper middle class household. Potter and her brother had numerous pets and would spend holidays with their family in Scotland and the Lake District. While growing up she developed a love of landscapes, flora, fauna, and the countryside; much of which she would closely observe and paint. Potter was an avid botanist and scientific illustrator; she is widely respected in the field of mycology due to her studies and watercolor illustrations of fungi.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">From the ages of 14 to 30 she kept a journal where she would record her thoughts, opinions (written in a secret code she developed), illustrations, and stories based on her pets. This stories were the start of her writing and illustration career. Potter's first published work was <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i>, self-published in 1902 and based on her pet rabbit Peter. Peter Rabbit became the first fictional character made into a patented stuffed toy becoming the oldest licensed character and showcasing Potter as a pioneer of merchandising. After <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i>, Potter went on to write over 60 books, 23 of them children's books based on animals.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">While working on her stories and illustrations, Potter continued her passion for conservation and the preservation of the countryside by purchasing HillTop in 1905. Through the years she went on to purchase additional farms in the surrounding area in an effort to preserve the unique hill country landscape of Near Sawery. In this time, she became a prize winning breeder of Herdwick sheep. Potter continued writing and illustrating until late in her life when land management duties and a diminishing of her eyesight made it difficult to continue her illustration and writing. She died of pneumonia and heart disease on December 22, 1943 at the age of 77. She left her property to the National Trust and is credited with preserving the land that now makes up the Lake District National Park.</p>
